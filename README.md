# Predicting-Credit-Card-Churn-For-A-Bank
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of customer churn at a bank. My primary objective is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition in credit card services after a preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis followed by Machine Learning-based techniques.
Customer churn in credit card services is a critical issue, causing revenue loss, higher marketing expenses, and potential damage to a company's reputation. Globally, financial institutions face significant challenges due to such churn. From a business standpoint, it is crucial to promptly address this problem with management, as attrition can trigger a detrimental snowball effect. In the context of a small bank, above-average churn rates may indicate a lack of trust in the institution or ineffective marketing strategies, possibly promoting unsuitable products to the wrong target audience. The analysis highlights key factors influencing customer churn. An actionable recommendation for targeted customer retention strategies would be continuous monitoring and model refinement, which are essential for adapting to changing customer behaviors and market dynamics. Implementing this can significantly reduce churn rates, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
